# Template Selection

Next.js full-stack application template optimized for Google App Engine. Perfect for applications that require both server-side rendering and API routes, with database integration and server-side logic.

Use when:
- Full-stack applications with API routes
- Server-side rendering (SSR) requirements
- Applications needing database connections
- Dashboards, admin panels, and SaaS applications
- E-commerce sites with backend processing
- Applications requiring authentication and authorization
- Deploying to Google App Engine with Node.js runtime

Avoid when:
- Static websites or landing pages (use client-only template)
- You need Cloudflare Workers-specific features
- You need direct access to Cloudflare bindings (KV, D1, Durable Objects)
- Lightweight frontend-only projects

Note: Optimized for Google Cloud Platform (App Engine) with Node.js runtime. Supports both server-side rendering and API routes. Can integrate with Firestore, Cloud SQL, or other GCP services.

Built with:
- **Next.js (Page Router)** for hybrid static & server rendering, built-in SEO, and routing
- **API Routes** for backend functionality
- **Tailwind CSS** for rapid UI development
- **Lucide Icons** for consistent iconography
- **Framer Motion** for animations
- **TypeScript** and **ESLint** for type safety and code quality
